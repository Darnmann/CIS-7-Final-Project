# CIS-7-Final-Project
This program starts with a weighted graph given in the CIS-7 class. The goal is determine the best way for a solar salesman to travel through the cities of Perris, Riverside, Moreno Valley, and Hemet. 
I, Darreck Craiu am the sole author of the program and its documentation. The github for the program was published on December 8, 2023.

Instructions: All you need are your number keys. You ahve 5 options to choose from, the 5th being an exit program option. The first option will calculate and print all possible routes the solar salesman can take through the cities. 
The second option will calculate and print the most efficient routes he can take from each city. The third option will calculate and print an adjacency list of the cities/vertices, and their roads/edges including the miles/weights.
the fourth option will print the graph in the console in text form. It will give you the cities, their roads, their connections to each other, and the distances for each road. 
I used a 2D array to represent the weighted graph. The two indices are the two cities being related the value of the element at that index is the weight of the edge between them. Everything else was done using vectors, arrays, and
permutations of arrays in order to caluculate and group data to be shown to the user. 
Thank you for taking the time to check out the program!
